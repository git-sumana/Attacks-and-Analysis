### Description:
A brute-force attack was detected involving the user account so and so. The source system attempted to log in many times within 5 minutes.

### Observations:
- A significant number of failed login attempts were detected
- The target username is used in all the failed login attempts, suggesting that an attacker may be targeting this specific user account.

### Recommendations:
1. Kindly verify if this activity was done by the user or not.
2. Immediately reset the password for the account user and initiate an account lockout or session invalidation. Monitor the account for any further suspicious activity.
3. Enable or tighten rate-limiting and account lockout policies to prevent further brute-force attempts. Consider adding multi-factor authentication (MFA) to further protect sensitive accounts.

### Risk Factor:
- **High**: The large number of failed login attempts and the successful logins indicate a high risk of unauthorized access and potential data breach.
