## Description
In external traffic, "IP name" (public) triggered an anomalous number of HTTP 400 errors in the last 5.0 minutes. The failure percentage rate was 100%. This host has had a weighted anomaly score of 30. This can indicate an attacker is scanning for pages to exploit.

## Observations:
1. The public IP displayed suspicious behavior in external traffic, generating an anomalous number of 30 HTTP 400 errors.
2. The errors occurred within a brief timeframe of 5 minutes, indicating potentially automated activity.
3. The failure percentage rate of 100% suggests all requests made by this IP resulted in unsuccessful responses.
4. The host's weighted anomaly score of 30 highlights the likelihood of malicious intent.
5. These patterns strongly imply the host may be conducting automated probing or scanning activities to find vulnerabilities.

## Recommendations:
1. Kindly block this IP at all network security layers — including the firewall, IDS/IPS, WAF, and load balancer — to ensure comprehensive prevention of further probing or access attempts, if not related to business operations.
2. If the IP originates from a region with no business requirement, consider geo-blocking or IP reputation filtering to reduce future noise from known bad sources.
3. Use internal tools or a third-party service to run external vulnerability scans and ensure your internet-facing assets are secure and patched.

## Risk Factors:
1. **Potential Data Breach**: If the probing is successful, it could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
2. **Service Disruption**: Automated scanning can lead to increased load on servers, potentially causing service disruptions.
3. **Reputation Damage**: Repeated attacks can harm the organization's reputation if not addressed promptly.
4. **Financial Loss**: Addressing breaches and service disruptions can incur significant costs.
5. **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Failing to protect against such threats may result in non-compliance with data protection regulations.
